  ## Tests
   Insomnia is used to test REST API calls. Please see the walk-through demonstration videos as well as the sections on Description and Usage to see how data is added and tested using Insomnia. 

  1. When the API GET routes for users and thoughts are opened in Insomnia, the data for each of the routes is displayed in formatted JSON.

  2. When the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, the user can successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the user's database.

  3. When the API POST and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, the user can successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts, and add and remove friends to a user's friend list.
  
  The following API routes are created to add and test data:
